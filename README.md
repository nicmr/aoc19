# aoc19 - Advent of Code 2019

My solutions to the [Advent of code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) programming challenge.

## Technologies used

- *Language:* [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)
- *Build Tool:* [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)

## What I learned so far

- Get comfortable with `Monad`, `Functor`, `Applicative`
- Basic Parsing Combinators with `megaparsec` . Previously I only had experience with ReadP.
- Testing with `tasty` and `tasty-hunit`


## View my solutions 

All implementations can be found in [./src/](./src).  
Generally the solution for *day x* will correspond to a `DayX.hs` source file.

## How to run my solutions
```zsh
stack run DAY
```

e.g. for day 1

```zsh
stack run 1
```
